This is the front end code for Chapman's Gem & Mineral Shop. The client wanted a site with a simple, modern feel, 
immediately communicating necessary information to potential customers passing through the area, nothing more. 
For my own practice, I included a system to register and authorize users to manipulate an inventory. This system
will be left out of the version given to Chapman's.

### Summary
This app has purpose for the shop's customers, and for the employees. Being visible from HWY 101 in the midst of 
Nortern California's Redwood forest brings a lot of tourists. It was decided that most site traffic will be from 
these tourists, making split decisions about what attractions to visit while on the road. The tourist will be
immediately presented with the shop's outstanding reviews, hours, and location. If we still have the potential
customer's attention, they may continue exploring the shop's history, gallery, museum, or contact the shop through
email. An employee of the shop may sign up, sign in, and manipulate the shop's inventory.
